            <p class=" text-sm md:text-lg text-gray-700 drop-shadow-lg leading-relaxed">Hi! I'm Phaolap Kulteera, a Computer Engineering student at Chulalongkorn University.
                I enjoy building web applications that combine beautiful design with powerful performance.
                I'm especially passionate about full-stack development, using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and currently exploring backend technologies like Node.js and Go.
                My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer who not only writes clean code but also understands how users think.
                Iâ€™m currently open to software engineering internship opportunities.
